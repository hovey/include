  abstract = {{The Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) military specification (mil-spec) provides blunt impact acceleration criteria that must be met before use by the U.S. warfighter. The specification, which requires a helmeted magnesium Department of Transportation (DOT) headform to be dropped onto a steel hemispherical target, results in a translational headform impact response. Relative to translations, rotations of the head generate higher brain tissue strains. Excessive strain has been implicated as a mechanical stimulus leading to traumatic brain injury (TBI). We hypothesized that the linear constrained drop test method of the ACH specification underreports the potential for TBI.To establish a baseline of translational acceleration time histories, we conducted linear constrained drop tests based on the ACH specification and then performed simulations of the same to verify agreement between experiment and simulation. We then produced a high-fidelity human head digital twin and verified that biological tissue responses matched experimental results. Next, we altered the ACH experimental configuration to use a helmeted Hybrid III headform, a freefall cradle, and an inclined anvil target. This new, modified configuration allowed both a translational and a rotational headform response. We applied this experimental rotation response to the skull of our human digital twin and compared brain deformation relative to the translational baseline.The modified configuration produced brain strains that were 4.3 times the brain strains from the linear constrained configuration.We provide a scientific basis to motivate revision of the ACH mil-spec to include a rotational component, which would enhance the test’s relevance to TBI arising from severe head impacts.}},
